			<h1><span>About</span></h1>
			<p>
			Hello, I am Carson and I am the host of this site. 
			I enjoy programming, reading (computer/math books), listening to music, and hacking.
			As of today (5/22/2022), I am studying for the CompTIA Network+ to put one foot onto the path of learning the fundamentals cyber security.
			<br></br>
			If you would like to communicate with me please reach out to my email <a href="mailto:carson@frankovich.dev">carson@frankovich.dev</a>. 
			You can find (almost) all of the stuff I work on on my <a href="https://github.com/cfrankovich">github</a> with the pins being my most recent project(s).
			Most content on this page will be posted in the blog section of the site. 
			As an alternative to Instagram, I will be posting pictures in <a href="./pics">pics</a>.
			All the music that I've made, I don't want to publish just yet; however, if I ever feel like it, all music I make will be posted here.
			<br></br>	
			I plan to get this site running off of my own hardware to allow for comments/suggestions/feedback in the near future so stay tuned ^-^

				<h1><span>current project</span></h1>
				<p>
				I'm working on a project called "<a href="https://github.com/cfrankovich/procedural-generation-demo">procedural-generation-demo</a>" (creative name... i know).
				I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20KHNA9jTsE">this</a> video and to fully immerse myself in the concepts taught, this project was essential.
				<br></br>
				For a quick rundown, the video informs the audience on an algorithm called the "Wave Function Collapse Algorithm."
				This algorithm is prevalent in game development for procedurally generated maps. 
				Once I finish this program I will write a blog post on it explaining everything I have learned.	
				<br></br>
				If you would like to read up on it before then, <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/">this</a> article is a great source.
