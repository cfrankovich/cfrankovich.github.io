			<p>
				I'm Carson. In the professional world, I would consider myself a programmer. 
				To my friends I'm a programmer, musician, and fashion lover.
				<br></br>
				By saying "programmer" I don't mean the type to mindlessly type away on their keyboard to make something work. 
				When I use a computing language, its only a tool for the greater picture (what really interests me).  
				Programming things helps me understand <i>how</i> things work and gives me complete* control of what I want done. 
				This idea is rather fascinating to me and provides a blank canvas for any idea or theory one may have as you build the solution from the ground up. 
				I actually find programming rather boring when not working on a complex or interesting idea/project as it feels like I'm just writing html (yes i hate webdev). 
				<br></br>
				One particular subject thats peaking my interest now is math or exploring how things work mathematically. 
				Every time I look into a model or system through mathematics, it allows me to truly understand how and why things work.
				As cliche as it sounds, math is truly the language of the universe and can explain everything.
				If you have any cool or fun topics that I should look into feel free to contact me I would love it.
