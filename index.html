			<h1><span>About</span></h1>
			<p>
			Hello, I'm Carson! 
			<br></br>
			I'm currently a student attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering (expected 2026).
			I love all sorts of things ranging from music, fashion, and technology.
			My passion for programming and technology came to me when I was talking about a summer camp with my friend that he had previously attended. 
			He showed me one of his projects he made during that camp which was a gravity simulation showcasing thousands of particles interacting with each other. 
			This fascinated me. 
			I've never seen what code looks like in person before and let alone it running with the power to change anything the author wishes.
			Seeing all the amazing possibilities programming could achieve, I began self studying in 2020.
			I started out with small projects like a calculator and eventually worked my way up to algorithmic procedural map generation!
			Learning has always been one of my favorite things to do as I unlock new tools and skills to continue my career in software development.
			I've done a lot of things since that summer day and eventually worked my way into college to study software engineering under scholarship and I don't plan to stop there!
			<br></br>	
			This website is a place for me to blog about whatever is on my mind, host files, and act as my "safe space" online.
			In the future, I would like to host this site on an old laptop so I can introduce dynamic features like commenting on my blogs, a contact section, and so much more!
			For now, everything on this site is static and you can find the entire repository on my <a href="https://github.com/cfrankovich/cfrankovich.github.io">github</a>.

				<h1><span>current personal project</span></h1>
				<p>
				As of today (09/18/2022), I am working on a Lyapunov Fractal renderer. 
				The math behind this is very interesting and showcases a beautiful fractal as a result.
				Once I finish, a new blog will be posted explaining everything.
				<br></br>
				Keep up with the project on <a href="https://github.com/cfrankovich/LyapunovsFractal">github</a>.
