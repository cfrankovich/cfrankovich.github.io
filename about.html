		I'm <b>Carson Frankovich</b>. I graduate High School in June 2022 and I'll then be attending <b>Embry Riddle Aeronautical University</b> to study <b>software engineering</b> and <b>cyber security</b>.
		This website that you are on is kind of like my work of art. As you explore this website, you'll find out more about me than this about page could ever cover.

		There are many things that I enjoy but the one that stands out to me and to others is <b>programming</b>.
		I enjoy making programs ranging from mathematical simulations to 2d games. 
		Just the idea that I can tell a computer, which is a calculator on steroids, what and how I want something done fascinates me.
		I've done some relatively small and easy projects which you can check out on my github.

		Aside from technology, I enjoy designing and criticising <b>fashion</b>. 
		My favorite designers/brands as of now are 1017 Alyx, Rick Owens, Undercover, and Number (N)ine. 
		No, I don't own any clothing from these brands but it is a dream to work hard for.

		Another thing about me that stands out to most of my friends is my taste and love for <b>music</b>. 
		I don't want to go deep into who and what I like here (you can read all about it on my music page) but I will say that Destroy Lonely is my favorite artist.
		Ambient rap isn't the only genre I listen to. You can find vaporwave, jazz, and punk music in my downloads as well.

		That's enough about me. Let's talk about this website and what I envision for it. This website is kind of my "safe space" to rant and talk to myself.
		Most of my peers do not want to listen to me talk about subjects that they have no clue over so here is where I redirect all of those thoughts.
		The about page of this website is literally just this page. The blog section is where you will find lengthy texts relating to my thoughts or opinions on some random subject.
		Music contains information about what I listen to and provides files with audio for a sneak peak. Finally, thoughts are just random short thoughts that could not make it onto my blog.
