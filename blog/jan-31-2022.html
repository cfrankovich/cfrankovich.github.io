		<h2>future plans.</h2>
		<h3>server.</h3>
		<p>
		This is the first time I've updated this website since December 3rd, 2021. I've always wanted to kind of talk to myself here and blog so I can come back in the future and read these but I never had anything to talk about.
		However, today I have something to talk about. I've been wanting to do this for a while now and writing this blog post will motivate me to do it even more.
		<br></br>
		I want to completely move this website and all of my github repositories on my own server. Will it be annoying? Probably. Will it be hard to set up? Yes. I have no idea what I am doing.
		However, this is what I love about technology. You never stop learning anything and there is always something new and cool you can do. For me, it just happens to be setting up a git and web server.
		Now thinking about it, I might download all of my favorite music and store it on the server just incase it gets taken down (I listen to a lot of unreleased songs that aren't supposed to be available).
		<br></br>
		Aside from the learning opportunity, I will be breaking the chains that big tech companies have on me. As of now, I am completely dependent on proprietary software and big tech to keep this website up.
		Using my own server will allow me to have full control of my own stuff without the fear of my data being harvested or worse, my website and code completely wiped from existance with no reason.
		Now realistically, I am just being a little paranoid but there is no harm in doing this.
		<br></br>
		Regarding the hardware that my server will be running on, the laptop has a 4 core Intel i5-2450M clocked at 3.1GHz, 4GB of RAM, and 500GB of storage.
		Obviously, this isn't the best of the best but its better than nothing! I don't plan on upgrading or spending more money just to upgrade a server that might get around 3 visits a month.
		<br></br>
		To wrap things up about the server, I am really excited to research and learn about possible security problems, how I can efficiently serve html to clients wanting to connect, and possibly learn to serve music to clients if possible. 
		</p>
		<h3>extra.</h3>
		<p>
		Honestly, I could have written another blog just on this but theres no use since the length is so small.
		<br></br>
		I want to move away from social media once again due to the creepy nature of certain ads I get and how it takes up a large portion of my time away from me.
		A hard thing about moving away from platforms like Inst*gram, Sn*pchat, and D*scord is communication with my friends and posting on my story. 
		<br></br>
		Posting on my story to vent and get random things off my mind occur frequently so I'm planning to just move that here instead (even if no one reads).
		Just thinking and writing about stuff can clear my mind and improve my mental health.
		<br></br>
		Yes, I will post about tech a lot but I am also planning to post stuff about other topics which I'm not completely sure of yet. But, whatever it is I'm sure I'll make it work.
		<br></br>
		Thank you for reading and have a good day :)
