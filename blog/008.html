		The following speech is a school project.<br><br>"Value your freedom or you will lose it" is a well known quote by Richard Stallman, a programmer and free software activist. Stallman is an advocate founded the GNU project in 1983 with the goal to give the user control and freedom in their day to day computing activities. The GNU project went on to be one of the most influential projects in computing history and is used in over 90% of computers today. With the success of the GNU project, its philosophy spread creating a new movement for free software and even led to Stallman founding the Free Software Foundation. <br><br>Before I deliberate the case on proprietary software, we must first understand what free software is and isn't. Free software is software which respects the users' freedom and community. This is also called "libre software" to accentuate that it is about liberty, not price. The freedom of having control over your own life is an unalienable right and was one of the key points in the United States' Declaration of Independence. With the notoriety of technology, many use computers to carry out activities in their lives. This attests that one's freedom depends on their ability to control the programs that they are using.<br><br>There are four essential freedoms that must be granted for software to be considered free. The freedom to run the program for any purpose, study the program's source code, make and distribute exact copies, and make and distribute modified versions. With these four freedoms, the user is in complete control of the program. The first two freedoms respect the individual's control and the last two grant users to exercise collective control over the program. If one of these are taken away the program becomes proprietary.<br><br>Freedom and liberty are binary. You are either free to control the program or the program controls you. With proprietary software, the developer or owner of a program that controls the program, has power over its users. Therefore, this allows for the proprietor to make malicious versions of the program which users are not aware of. There are many flaws and malicious features of proprietary software software but the three most prevalent are surveillance, back doors, and censorship. <br><br>Surveillance is by far the most ubiquitous trait found in proprietary software today. Companies have been collecting data on it's users as long as the world wide web has existed. There are even some companies like Meta who solely generate income from the monetization of their users' data and activities online. This data is typically sold to marketing companies to maximize profits without respecting the user. Spyware does not grant the user an option to consent or deny access to their data. In addition, most of these programs won't even tell the user whether they snoop on the users for a government entity. This invasion of personal privacy is an invasion on a peaceful state of mind and a breach on trust between the two parties. There is no difference on whether the proprietor is a single developer, a company, or a government because the proprietor will inevitably use the users' personal data for their own benefit and greed.<br><br>Surveillance can also be the cause of a back door. Frankly, all of proprietary software's malicious functionalities are mediated by back doors. Back doors are features of a program which allows for unauthorized access to either data or the computer itself. One example of a program back door is Amazon's Kindle. In July of 2009, Amazon decided to remove a copy of "Nineteen Eighty-four" and "Animal Farm" by George Orwell from all Kindles. Naturally, users where outraged by this because they paid for the e books and did not receive a refund. This signifies that Amazon has full control of the user's and their property and made Kindle users on edge wondering if their favorite book will also be removed. In more recent times, Adobe decided to kill off Adobe Flash Player by blocking Flash content. In January 2021, Adobe Flash Player's time was finally up and suddenly stopped working without an update. This indicated that Adobe had access to every Flash Player and who knows what other things Adobe had done with such a popular program. <br><br>Google Chrome is dominating the market share of browsers with over 2.65 billion people around the world using it. Most users decide to install an ad blocker through the chrome web store extensions page when setting up their browser to get rid of advertisements to be more productive and reduce surveillance. However, in 2017 Google went on a censoring spree banning many ad blockers from the chrome web store and uninstalling these on their users' computers. Censorship does not only mean restricting programs on a computer, it could also be defined as restricting ones speech and representation. This is typically seen in social media sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. With the power these companies have by deleting and suspending posts or users, they can shape public opinion with ease. Political opinions aside, it is important to remember that what is considered as "right" and "wrong" are in complete control of the proprietor on these sites meaning that these sites are a perfect medium in which governments can spread propaganda. For example, the Russian government is utilizing the proprietary software to censor people in support of Ukraine. And in some countries like China, they utilize proprietary software to completely eliminate opposing opinions thus eliminating the individual's right to think for themselves and develop their own opinion.<br><br>In conclusion, if the four essential freedoms are implemented and practiced with software, the dangers of proprietary software will cease to exist. It's time to realize that you are not in control of your technology or anything you do online. Proprietary software will always have a noxious nature to it and the continued growth of people understanding the free software philosophy will hopefully present a new light for people around the world to break the chains between them and the proprietor who controls their software and computing activities.
