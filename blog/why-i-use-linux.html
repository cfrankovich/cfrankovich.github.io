		<h2>why i use linux.</h2>
		<p>
		I've heard some criticism about my choice in using linux as my
		main desktop and some other things I'll write about soon. Upon
		hearing these amusing statements I couldn't help but writing
		this ridiculous blog page on it. I'll start out by addressing
		why I use linux and then dive into the whole sheep nonsense. 
		<br></br>
		Yes. A minimalist distro like arch linux is not what
		someone would naturally think of when the word "Operating
		System" comes to mind. Arch has a reputation for breaking and
		being a difficult distro to use. So why do I use it? The
		answer is simple. I want to. There are some key reasons on why
		I want to use it but before I talk about those I want to point
		out that using a different OS from everyone else doesn't make
		me special, better, or cooler. It's simply another operating
		system that I voluntarily chose to use and one should not judge
		the way I compute the same way one should not judge for music
		taste. Now there are a couple of reasons why I think that
		everybody should use at least some form of linux. 
		<br></br>
		Generally speaking, linux is F.O.S.S. (free [and] open source
				software.) This means that there is no
		proprietor controlling the user of the system or program they
		created. Of course, not all proprietary software is evil but it
		is best to not use it when possible. Free software gives the
		freedom to the user to view and modify source code of said
		software. Does everybody know how to read and write code? Of
		course not! The thing that matters most is that the opportunity
		is there when the user has the freedom to view and modify the
		source code of programs they use. Proprietary code also
		typically comes with spyware. Let's take innocent software like
		<a
		href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-for-home-and-school-faq?legRedir=true&CorrelationId=c9c5b549-11ad-4f71-bf81-b7e069fdb372">Microsoft
		Office</a> as an example. Software bundled in this package
		require that you make a microsoft account and connect to the
		internet upon installing! Why would Microsoft want you to make
		an account? I'll leave that question for you to debate. Spyware
		is a touchy subject since most users simply do not care about
		their lives being spied on so it all depends on personal
		preference. Proprietary software also does things that the user
		typically does not want! Backdoors, censorship, and
		surveillance (which we already covered.) The most recent
		backdoor that I have experienced is actually on my Chrome Book.
		I have refused to update my system for a while since it would
		break compatibility of a method I used to boot debian on it.
		Google programmed ChromeOS to have a universal backdoor that is
		used for updating the system. I never used Chrome OS except as
		a boot loader for debian but at one point Chrome OS did not
		start as expected and forced the update upon me. Gee I sure
		hope that <a
		href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/08/22/buying_a_chromebook_dont_forget_to_check_when_it_expires/">I
		would still be able to compute despite not wanting to update my
		OS</a>. I can go on and on about proprietary software just <a
		href="../contact">ask me</a> about it and I'll be happy to
		talk.
		<br></br>
		I can't bring up why I use linux without mentioning the
		security reasons. Malware is more common on Windows. This is
		due to a number of reasons but an argument that is brought up the
		most is that Windows is the most used operating system on the
		market. Why does this matter? Well, since most people use
		windows as their main OS, this means that there are more
		targets for a black hat to attack. Now before I explain this, I
		should bring up 2 main reasons why black hats do what they do.
		They either attack for money or publicity. Now explain to me.
		If you were a black hat hacker, why would you ever target a
		small percentage of users if you want to gain the most money or
		publicity you can possible? Not to mention that linux users are
		generally more "tech savy" than the average windows user. Of
		course, there are more reasons than just stereotypes on why
		linux is more secure like the kernel. On linux and other UNIX
		based systems (macos too), device drivers are built into the
		kernel. On windows, device drivers are on top of the kernel.
		This is a major flaw since drivers are made to talk to
		hardware. If a driver were to be compromised, an attacker would
		have very low level access to the computer and this basically
		means they have full access to your computer. You may argue "oh
		b-but linux drivers means they can be compromised too!1!1!!"
		That is correct but on linux and other UNIX based systems, 3rd
		party drivers are frowned upon and are never even used unless
		they have to. On windows, almost all windows system requires
		third party drivers to be installed. This also ties back into
		the market where windows completely controls. Most companies
		will want to take advantage of this market and they make tech
		for people (like headphones for example) and usually require
		their own drivers to be installed. 
		<br></br>
		Installing software has never been easier that using a single
		command in the terminal. On a windows system, you have to first
		look up what you want to install on a web browser, find the
		correct link of what you want to install, click the download
		link that matches your system, then run an executable that
		takes you through multiple steps to install a program. On the
		other hand, most linux distros (if not all) simply
		requires you to type in a command into the terminal and
		installs the package for you with no extra steps. On arch, if
		the package is not in the database, you can try the AUR (Arch
				User Repository) which will most likely have
		the package you would want to install. Of course, some windows
		normies will install linux and try to get their proprietary
		programs like adobe reader, microsoft office, and maybe even
		their favorite program that spies on them. Fortunately,
		companies that make these programs don't even support a linux
		version! As an effect they'll <i>wine</i> (see what I did
				there) and cry about it and never touch linux
		again because it doesn't support the software that they use and
		love everyday. There are alternatives that are just as good if
		not better than your spyware. The software you use is just a
		tool to get something done.  
		<br></br>
		Linux is literally a sandbox. Especially minimal distros 
		like arch linux. I can decide what I want to install on my
		system and I can choose what I don't want to install on my
		system unlike certain other operating systems. This is more of
		a personal reason but I would like to include this in reasons
		that everybody should use linux since they can customize their
		computing to whatever they would like. Even if people don't
		know how to edit some files or install a couple packages, there
		are plenty of options available for noobs that need a <a
		href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-distros">just
		works distro</a>. That all act and behave differently. When I
		talk about my personal reasons, I'll explain why I enjoy having
		a sandbox. Why should you care about the way your computer
		works and looks? Well that's just up to you. Would you rather
		have Microsoft tell you what you must have or would you like a
		more freedom based approach that is more open ended? You
		choose.
