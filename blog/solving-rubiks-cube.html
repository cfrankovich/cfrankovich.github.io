                I've always owned Rubik's Cube. 
                It sat on my dusty shelf for years and years as I never caught interest in the puzzle.
                On a restful night, the cube caught my eye as I was about to sleep.
                I was interested to study the mathematics behind Rubik's cube and why such a simple puzzle was so popular.

				<br> <span class="subhead">Definitions</span> <br>
                <i>Rubik's Cube</i> - The cube I will be referencing in this blog. There are six colors/faces/states. White and yellow, red and orange, and green and blue are all opposite from eachother. 
				<br></br>
                <i>Node</i> - A piece of what Rubik's cube is made of. There are three different types of nodes: center, edge, and corner.
                <br></br>
                <i>Point</i> - A point on the cube is relative to the observer. In our model, we can name the sides front, right, left, top, bottom, back. Each side can be broken down into nine points we'll call these $ F_1, F_2, ..., F_9 $ starting from the top left as $ F_1 $ and the bottom right as $ F_9 $ where $ F $ is the face of the cube. The figure bellow contains these naming conventions.

				<br></br>
                We replace F with the starting letter for each face.

                <i>Node State</i> - The value or color that a point contains.  
				<br></br>
                <i>Center Node</i> -

                <i>Edge Node</i> -

                <i>Corner Node</i> -

                It won't take long after studying the cube to know what it is comprised of.
