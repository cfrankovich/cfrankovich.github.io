		<h2>laptops are getting worse.</h2>
		<p>
		New technology is interesting. Whether you like it or not is a
		completely different story but I think we can all agree that
		looking at new things is always cool. Today I was interested in
		what's new so I went to one of my favorite tech sites, <a
		href="https://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>, and I one of
		the featured articles was the new <a
		href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/dell-xps-15-9510-review-a-gorgeous-well-balanced-workstation-laptop/">Dell
		XPS 15 9510</a>. Curious, I visit the page and was soon in
		shock from the subtitle that stated "Limited ports and a
		midrange GPU don't detract much from an excellent laptop." This
		blog is just going to me ranting on how laptops are getting
		worse and worse.
		<br></br>
		First off, all modern laptops' goal is to be thin and weigh
		almost nothing. There are a couple of problems when it comes to
		a thinner laptop. The largest problem in my opinion is actually
		the keyboard. If a user is going to be using the laptop for an
		extended use of time, the keyboard must be comfy to type on.
		For example, if you own a thinner laptop type a sentence or two
		out and then do the same think but on your bare desk. It almost
		feels the same minus the actual feeling of the keyboard. Doing
		this for a long period of time can really put a strain on your
		fingers and eventually get tiring. I own four laptops and each
		one has a different keyboard feel and coincidentally, the
		thickest laptop has the best typing experience since there is
		more room to improve the keyboard. Again, it doesn't feel like
		I'm typing on my desk, it feels like an actual keyboard. If you
		ever see my in person with my laptop ask me to type on my
		laptop and you will be enlightened (not really but trust me
				its great). I should really divide these
		reasons in paragraphs but whatever. The next one is that
		cooling is HORRIBLE. If you own a macbook or another really
		thin laptop you know exactly what I'm talking about. The
		cooling solutions on a sleek and thin laptop are generally non
		existent. There is no room for a clean and efficient cooling
		solution, especially when doing heavy tasks like video
		rendering and gaming. This could be argued since there are
		great thermal engineers that have designed efficient cooling
		systems for thin laptops. I would also like to point out why do
		people want their laptops to weigh like a feather? Is it to
		heavy to carry around? What if you were carrying the laptop in
		your backpack and a thief comes to steal it? It would be hard
		to tell that your laptop has been stolen since the weight
		difference is almost nothing compared to other things one might
		keep in their backpack. Additionally since the laptop is
		lightweight, the more accident prone it is as well. Dropping
		something heavy is generally harder to do than dropping
		something light. This all depends on personal preference though
		so there is no point in arguing against someone's choice. 
		<br></br>
		More and more ports are leaving! This could be taken into
		account with laptops becoming thinner but I believe that less
		ports deserve their own paragraph. I don't believe that this
		"feature" applies to normies as much as I think it does.
		Everyone now uses the cloud and throws their data in the hands
		of large corporations in hopes of it not getting lost, stolen,
		hacked, or leaked. Cloud computing deserves its own blog but no
		one wants to use external hard drives or even a USB now! I'm
		not going to go over the main advantages of using USB's but the
		main one in my opinion is making a bootable usb to install
		linux. Besides that, even video ports like HDMI, DP, and VGA
		are now non existent on these computers. What if you need to
		plug in your laptop to present to a class or business
		executives? You have to pull out your 23 adapters you bought on
		amazon and get the right one. It's honestly getting to a point
		where the only port a laptop will have by 2040 is a charging
		port (all jokes). Why do companies want to
		remove important daily-use ports now? I won't ever get it and I
		refuse to buy a laptop that doesn't even have a USB port. That
		is ridiculous. 
		<br></br>
		This paragraph kind of dives into my reasoning for the x220 but
		newer laptops aren't easy to repair and upgrade. On my personal
		laptop, I can access the RAM, hard drive, and battery without
		having to open up the whole laptop. If one part breaks or I
		want to replace it, it is easy to do so. With a maximum of two
		screws to undo. You can see what I mean by viewing the image
		bellow.

		<p>
		I've heard an argument saying that an attacker can just take
		the battery out of my computer if they wanted to and this is
		true but why on earth would I leave my computer unattended?
		Plus there is a safety lock for the battery so it would take
		the attacker a second or two to snatch the battery if they
		really wanted to. And why take the battery out if you can just
		take the whole laptop? Makes no sense to me but yea sure...
		someone <i>can</i> take the battery if I was not looking and
		they were dumb enough to target the battery instead of the
		computer itself. 
		<br></br>
		To wrap things up, technology advancing is a great thing but we
		can't trade good features for the "next best thing." I would
		love to see a company bring back old style laptops back to the
		market in the future with modern components.
