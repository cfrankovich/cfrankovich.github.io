I added a sticky on the other sections of the site so I'll add one here explaining the blogs.
<br></br>
<b>The list view is horrible. Please don't use it. At the top, there is a catalog view button that makes it easier to view all blogs in a nice catalog so you don't have to scroll mindlessly.</b>
<br></br>
These blogs have no specific subject and are just random thoughts that I expand on. I'm planning to add a reply or comment feature once I get my server up and running.

I worked on a script for an extended period of time to make something easier for the first time ever. The something is uploading thoughts to my <a class="bloglink" href="../thoughts">>>>/thoughts/</a> page.
Yes, it does seem like a simple task but this is literally the first time I've written a bash script this long. It was the first time I've used sed outside of vim and I tried to not write horrible code.
<br></br>
The process began when I got home from school and as I was doing my homework, I took breaks in between to work on the script which was a HORRIBLE IDEA!
I was literally trying something new and breaking my thought process as I'm learning. Never doing that again.
<br></br>
If you would like to void my horrible explanation of the code, just look bellow and you'll find the massive chunk of code I use to upload thoughts.
<br></br>
Essentially, upon running the program, I can either use the standard input or arguments I pass it which contain the message.
The things that I look out for in the message are <span class="code">\n</span>(newline), <span class="code">></span>, and <span class="code"><</span>.
<br></br>
These special characters dictate new lines and quotes within the message or text I want to post.
I replace all the new lines with br's with <span class="code">sed -z "s/\n/br/g"</span> (except i use the angle brackets too) so there are new lines in the message.
After this, the script turns into an anomaly by looping through each character of the message and when I reach the angled brackets, I replace it with the html syntax to make it green.
The "closing" angle bracket is used to conclude the quote instead of a new line.
<br></br>
After the finding and replacing is done, I simply just replace the file with the new one and push the changes to github. If you want to see the code go to the full blog page which is at <a class="bloglink" href="./005">>>/blog/005/</a> if you're interested.
<br></br>
The script is really useful and typing/editing html is a big pain in the rear so I'm planning to replicate this but for the blog and music section of the site too.

Today was one of the coolest days I've had in a while. I ventured down to Miami's Design District to see high end fashion up close and in person.
I mainly went down there to see my favorite fashion brand's stores (Rick Owens, Celine, and Chrome Hearts) but I also had quite the experience doing everything else there.
<br></br>
It all started this morning when I was in my car about to go to school. I was talking to a friend about how I was bummed out about a number of things and going to school would make matters worse.
I wanted to clear my mind and venture out from where I live to go see life instead of repeating the same old school once again. I decided to go visit the design district to see those stores I previously mentioned to motivate me to work harder in life and to get a taste of what high end fashion is.
<br></br>
After making sure I was ready, I headed out of the school parking lot curious to see what lie ahead. The first thing I noticed was the horrible traffic involved getting to the city.
Not only was the time to get to my destination was increased but the pollution and littering was horrible.
It was depressing seeing the amount of cars traveling all emitting exhaust as they travel to their destination.
I'm not really an environmental guy but it really broke me seeing animals becoming accustomed to the city lifestyle as they walked across the hot asphalt and ate trash off the ground.
<br></br>
Anyways, I eventually made it to the district and I was blown away by the area and how different it was compared to home. Now granted, this was regarded as a really artistic and fancy place so naturally the area was inevitably going to be nice but I could tell it was something special.
I found some parking and made my way out of the car to get a closer look at some stores and artwork. Unfortunately, it was early in the morning (9am) so all of the stores were closed but their windows had outfits and clothes for the passer by to see.
<br></br>
All of the stores here are much different than your average retail experience. These high end stores were not just a store, but also a work of art. There were no signs and extra things that scream "buy me!" near the shop.
There was one "store" that simply had a table and four chairs on the inside with one knocked over. Some of these stores made me question why these companies would even rent this space out to not display anything or be minimal but I soon realized that this was the aesthetic of the whole area and modern fashion.
<br></br>
I visited a coffee shop during my stay and expected the prices to be ridiculously high but to my surprise, it wasn't terrible. I had a cup of coffee for only three (US) dollars and the people inside were nice to me.
Even though the coffee shop was next to these stores I mentioned, it still had that same artsy feel.
<br></br>
All of these stores acted like the owner's canvas making each building unique but also felt similar due to the artistic nature of each building. Nothing felt out of place here and even the bright and colorful nature of the coffee shop next to the eerie, sinister look of Rick Owens looked normal.
Bellow are two close up photos I took and I'm now realizing I should have taken more but I'm more of a memory guy than a photo one.

This is the first time I've updated this website since December 3rd, 2021. I've always wanted to kind of talk to myself here and blog so I can come back in the future and read these but I never had anything to talk about.
However, today I have something to talk about. I've been wanting to do this for a while now and writing this blog post will motivate me to do it even more.
<br></br>
I want to completely move this website and all of my github repositories on my own server. Will it be annoying? Probably. Will it be hard to set up? Yes. I have no idea what I am doing.
However, this is what I love about technology. You never stop learning anything and there is always something new and cool you can do. For me, it just happens to be setting up a git and web server.
Now thinking about it, I might download all of my favorite music and store it on the server just incase it gets taken down (I listen to a lot of unreleased songs that aren't supposed to be available).
<br></br>
Aside from the learning opportunity, I will be breaking the chains that big tech companies have on me. As of now, I am completely dependent on proprietary software and big tech to keep this website up.
Using my own server will allow me to have full control of my own stuff without the fear of my data being harvested or worse, my website and code completely wiped from existance with no reason.
Now realistically, I am just being a little paranoid but there is no harm in doing this.
<br></br>
Regarding the hardware that my server will be running on, the laptop has a 4 core Intel i5-2450M clocked at 3.1GHz, 4GB of RAM, and 500GB of storage.
Obviously, this isn't the best of the best but its better than nothing! I don't plan on upgrading or spending more money just to upgrade a server that might get around 3 visits a month.
<br></br>
To wrap things up about the server, I am really excited to research and learn about possible security problems, how I can efficiently serve html to clients wanting to connect, and possibly learn to serve music to clients if possible.
