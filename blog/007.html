		Last night, I finally landed my first ollie. The said ollie is obviously in the webm attached to this post (its a little loud careful). <br><br>For the past week or so, I've tried to learn to long board since I think its a fun and stylish mode of transportation that I want to take with me to university. Once I learned to do basic maneuvers, I got bored since there was nothing else to really do on a long board.<br>I wanted to pick up a skateboard but I also didn't want to spend any extra money if I didn't have to. Luckily, my friend had an old skateboard just lying around his garage collecting dust so naturally I asked him if I could have/borrow it and that's how I ended up with my board! <br><br>I've kinda been lazy when it comes to skateboarding since I've wanted to do it for a long time. I don't really know what inspires me to skate but I love watching skateboarding videos in my free times if that counts.<br><br>Since I've already watched skateboarding videos (for a couple years... kinda sad now thinking about it) before I knew what tricks to chase first and methods to practice them. Long boarding for around a week also helped me get comfortable with standing on a piece of wood with four wheels underneath so I already knew how to rid so I already knew how to ride. <br><br>I immediately started working towards landing my first ollie so I could have a solid foundation for other cool tricks. I've practiced it for 2 days (2/10 and 2/11) and I've landed a few ollies but I was lacking consistenc started working towards landing my first ollie so I could have a solid foundation for other cool tricks. I've practiced it for 2 days (2/10 and 2/11) and I've landed a few ollies but I was lacking consistency. <br><br><span class="greentext">>can you ollie over stuff?<br>no. still cant be consistent while rolling/moving but thats what im planning to work on today.<br><br>I don't want to make this post giant but I also finished the blog script so hopefully it works because this post is the first time I'm using it in a non-testing environment. <br>
